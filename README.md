## Description

[Visit the deployed site](https://michellebaker1129.github.io/portfolio-challenge/)

My portfolio, Michelle Baker Brown, showing what I have learned so far.

## Usage

This website will be a lovely way to show off what I can do, and help potential employers know a bit more about me and my skills.

## Learning Points

HTML - I learned how to organize divs, elements, classes and IDs so that my HTML body connects with my CSS styling.

CSS - I learned so many ways to apply styling to my work, even to the smallest elements. I spent a lot of time here to understand the correct syntax, flexbox, image links and many other things.
